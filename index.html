		<div>About Me:

Hello I am a NYC based DJ.  I watched an egregious amount of MTV as a child back when they played music which now comes in handy.  If I had to choose between Madonna or Lady Gaga, I’d go with Fleetwood Mac, between George Michael or Beyonce, Beyonce, Bieber or Selena Gomez? Fleetwood Mac!

Some Places I’ve Played: 
The Green Building, Greenpoint Loft, The Park, Sky Gallery, 501 Union, Berlin, Black and White, The Gold Door, 9th Ward.
